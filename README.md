📚 WKIS Database Scripts Collection 🛠️
Welcome to my collection of PL/SQL scripts designed for the WKIS database! 
Below you'll find a set of scripts aimed at managing employee salaries and commissions according to specific rules. Let's dive into each script:

1. Salary Adjustment Rules 💰
Rule 1:
If an employee’s salary exceeds the president’s, it's adjusted to 25% less than the president's salary.

Rule 2:
If an employee’s salary is less than $100, it's increased by 10%, provided that the average company salary remains higher.

2. Commission Adjustment Rule 📊
If an employee's commission exceeds 22% of their salary, it's adjusted to the lowest commission within their department.

3. Exception Handling 🚨
Each script incorporates robust exception handling to address any unexpected errors during execution.

🚀 How to Use:
Execute each script in a PL/SQL environment connected to the WKIS database.
First Execute: create_emp script
Monitor the output for any errors or exceptions during script execution.
Enjoy streamlined management of employee salaries and commissions!
📝 Note:
